    <h2>About the Project</h2>
    <p>The 3D Maze Game project was inspired by our love for classic arcade games and our passion for creating interactive experiences. As a team of Holberton School students, we were excited to take on this challenge and showcase our skills in game development.</p>
    <p>The project took us several weeks to complete, from brainstorming ideas to coding, testing and debugging. It was a challenging but rewarding experience, and we are proud of the final result.</p>
    <p>This project is part of our portfolio for Holberton School, where we are learning software engineering </p>
